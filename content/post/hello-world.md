Hi!

I'm Travis Parker, a 32 year old developer from Marin County, California.

I work on [Pixinote](https://pixinote.com/). It's a simple app for sending lovely *physical* notes to the people you care about, you should totally try it!

I have lots of thoughts. They usually [stay in my head](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/30/building-expertise-at-work/) though. Here, I'll try and constrain them to software development and the community of developers.

I love [Julia Evans's blog](http://jvns.ca/) lately, so I'll be emulating her tone as best I can! It may not come naturally to me, but we need more enthusiasm and positivity in this industry so I'll do my best. Some ground rules for myself:

  1. Positive, friendly tone! Don't give in to that hipster angst or seductive pessimism.
  1. No looking anything up just because I'll be writing about it. First be honest about what I don't know, then if it's bugging me look it up after writing the post.

Dear reader (commenter really) is not off the hook:

  1. Reciprocate that tone please. It'll be easier on all of us.
  1. Go ahead and keep me honest. If I get lazy on my own ground rules, kindly [point it out](https://foxtype.com/politeness).

I'm super excited to lay my ideas and experience out on the table, and to periodically poke you on the shoulder for feedback. This is gonna be legendary!
